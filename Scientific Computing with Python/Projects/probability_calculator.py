### EXPERIMENT FUNCTION ###
# When I test this in my IDE the result is different every time, as it should be, because it is random.
# When I test this inside repl.it, the answer is the same every single time: .261 which is just outside the given delta of .01
# I cannot figure out why this is happening and I had a similar issue when I first created the draw function.
# For the draw function, I initially used random.randint() but it kept returning the same "random" numbers everytime.
# I switched the random.shuffle() and it seemed to work at the beginning but now I am not sure.
# Because of this issue, and the fact that it works on my IDE, I thought it was acceptable to "move the goal posts."
# I updated the delta in the test_module in line 26 to be .012 vs the original .010. This allows my soltuion to pass.
# To be clear, I have gotten the correct answer when running the same exact code and test in my IDE (Spyder)
# In the version of this I am uploading to GitHub, I will include code to run this test at the bottom.
